# Physics Calculator

## Purpose
This Python program serves as a physics calculator, allowing users to perform various physics calculations. It includes calculations for kinematic equations, gravitational force, and energy.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the program by executing the following command:
    ```bash
    python physics_calculator.py
    ```
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to choose a physics calculation and input the required values.

## Supported Physics Calculations

### 1. Kinematic Equations
   - Calculate final velocity and displacement using initial velocity, acceleration, and time.

### 2. Gravitational Force
   - Calculate the gravitational force between two objects using their masses and the distance between them.

### 3. Energy Calculation
   - Calculate gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy using mass and height.

## Unit Systems
   - The program supports both the International System of Units (SI) and the US customary units.
   - Choose the desired unit system (SI/US) at the beginning of the program.

## Additional Information
   - The program includes error handling for invalid user inputs.
   - Users can perform multiple calculations during a single run without restarting the program.
   - Mathematical operations are performed using the `math` library.
